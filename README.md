YouTube now adds a gross `si` attribute to links when you press `Share` on a video.
This appendage to the url doesn't do anything except tell YouTube where you clicked to get to the video.
It ruins the whole point of a **shortened** url for sharing.
This small extension removes that annoying feature.
